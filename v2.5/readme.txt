NOTES

Notes of building the Nav bar

* Also with fixed position, top 0, as well as with overflow property hidden and change colours on hovering
* some inspiration here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/overflow 

Notes on positioning elements on the website 

*I need to play with max-width, grow and direction to allocate space to elements on my page!!!


LATER
* transitions/animations
* different styles for indivdual pages- starting with the Notes blog 
* basci schemes for creating blog posts 
* but first i will revise the sections on positioning and animations - and apply them to the website as well
* add some sort of transition to my website and optimise it for the ipad that i have and Neha's and my phone
